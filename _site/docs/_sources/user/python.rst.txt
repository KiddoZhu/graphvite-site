Python Interface
================

GraphVite provides Python interface for convenient integration with other software.
To use GraphVite in Python

    >>> import graphvite as gv
    >>> import graphvite.application as gap

The GraphVite package itself provides interface to graphs, solvers, optimizers and
datasets. The application module provides the same interface to
:doc:`configuration`.

The following code gives an example of how to invoke training in Python

    >>> graph = gv.graph.Graph()
    >>> graph.load(gv.dataset.blogcatalog.train)
    >>> solver = gv.solver.GraphSolver(dim=128)
    >>> solver.build(graph)
    >>> solver.train()

To obtain the learned embeddings

    >>> embeddings = solver.vertex_embeddings
    >>> print(embeddings)
