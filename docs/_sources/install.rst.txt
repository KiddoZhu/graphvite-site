Install
=======

There are 2 ways to install GraphVite.

Install from conda
------------------

You can install GraphVite from ``conda`` with only one line.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install graphvite

By default, this will install all dependencies, including ``PyTorch`` and
``matplotlib``. If you only need embedding training without evaluation, you can take
the following alternative with minimum dependencies.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install graphvite-mini

Install from source
-------------------

Before installation, make sure your ``cmake`` is at least 3.12, and ``pybind11``
is installed.

First, clone GraphVite from GitHub.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/KiddoZhu/GraphVite

Then, use the following directives to compile the code. If you have installed ``faiss``
from source, you can pass ``-DFAISS_PATH=/path/to/faiss`` to ``cmake``.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd GraphVite
    mkdir build
    cd build && cmake .. && make && cd -

Finally, install Python bindings.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd python && python setup.py install && cd -
