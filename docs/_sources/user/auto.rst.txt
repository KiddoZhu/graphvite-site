Magic of Auto
=============

Hyperparameter tuning is usually painful for machine learning. In order to help you
focus on the most important part, GraphVite provides an auto deduction for many
hyperparameters. Generally, auto deduction will maximize the speed of the system,
while keep the performance loss as small as possible.

To invoke auto deduction, you can simply leave hyperparameters to their default
values. An explicit way is to use ``auto`` in configuration files, or value ``gv.auto``
in Python.

Here lists hyperparameters that support auto deduction.

.. code-block:: yaml

    resource:
        gpus: auto
        gpu_memory_limit: auto
        cpu_per_gpu: auto

    build:
        optimizer: auto
        num_partition: auto
        episode_size: auto

.. note::
    Due to the type cast between Python and C++, explicitly specify ``auto`` for
    ``gpus`` or ``optimizer`` will cause a type error. A work around is to use
    ``[]`` for ``gpus``, and leave ``optimizers`` as implicit.
